\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wait_for_ontology}{Wait\+For\+Ontology}} state. 

This class implements the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wait_for_ontology}{Wait\+For\+Ontology}} state of the final state machine, it is done once to create the ontology as the requirements of the assignments asked. It calls the Load\+Ontology function to do that. The Load\+Ontology has a particular structure with loops that do the same instruction two or three times. This is not an error but vouluntary done due to some bugs of the armor server. This is a solution I found to make things working and overcoming the bugs. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
scripts/\mbox{\hyperlink{assignment___f_s_m_8py}{assignment\+\_\+\+F\+S\+M.\+py}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
