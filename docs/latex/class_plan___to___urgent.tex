\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_plan___to___urgent}{Plan\+\_\+\+To\+\_\+\+Urgent}} state. 

This class implements the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_plan___to___urgent}{Plan\+\_\+\+To\+\_\+\+Urgent}} state of the final state machine, it gets the room reachable and the urgent ones. Then decides which room robot should reach. It calls the method for creting the path through \textquotesingle{}via\+\_\+points\textquotesingle{}, simulating in this way the behaviour of the real robot, then calls the function to move the robot in the room for the ontology.
